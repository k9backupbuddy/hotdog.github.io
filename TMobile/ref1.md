```What’s the difference between a truly connected device and a Bluetooth device? How do they work?```
```A smartwatch uses a SIM, (usually embedded, sometimes will actually require a SIM card), and network connection to provide features similar to a smartphone, without actually having to be connected to any handset. The idea is to leave the phone behind and still stay connected! Smartwatch features typically include the ability to call/text contacts, check social media, stream music, get news updates, make mobile payments, track activity and utilize your favorite apps.```

```A Bluetooth device means you can’t completely leave your phone behind – you do still need to have your watch connected to your handset to utilize the watch features.```

```What’s the difference between a smartwatch and an activity tracker?```
```Activity trackers are just what they sound like - they track your activity. These do not provide access to features such as being able to call or text contacts, make mobile payments, stream music, receive notifications, check social media feeds, check on news, etc. A smartwatch allows you to do all of this while leaving your phone behind, plus also will provide activity tracking so you only need to wear one device to get all the benefits!```
