```Our batteries are not only strong, but our proprietary power management technology makes them smart too. Instead of issuing a constant string of data, our hardware only connects to the network when the device senses an event you are interested in tracking and monitoring. This means that our batteries can last over a year without maintenance. We can even include a photovoltaic component, further prolonging the hardwareâ€™s useful life.```
