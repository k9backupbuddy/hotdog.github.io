```Of the five most popular mobile networks in the United States, Sprint, Verizon and Virgin Mobile use CDMA. T-Mobile and AT&T use GSM.```

```Coverage
While CDMA and GSM compete head-on in terms of higher bandwidth speed, GSM offers more complete global coverage thanks to roaming and international-roaming contracts. GSM technology tends to cover rural areas in the U.S. more completely than CDMA.```
```Simultaneous Voice and Data Usage
Most CDMA networks do not allow voice and data transmissions at the same time. This is why you may get bombarded with emails and other Internet notifications when you end a call from a CDMA network like Verizon. The data is basically on pause while you're on a phone call.```
