```Westchester County police are investigating after one of the department's narcotics dogs died in a patrol car in May.```

```Suki, a black Labrador retriever, was found unresponsive in a patrol car on May 20 after the car's temperature alert system either failed or was not set properly, said Kieran O'Leary, a Westchester County police spokesman.

She was rushed to a local animal hospital but could not be revived, he said.

"Our department is deeply saddened by her passing and grateful for Suki's service to our officers and the people of Westchester," O'Leary said.

Suki was 6 1/2 and had spent five years with the county police, helping uniformed patrol officers and the narcotics unit. She was assigned to the same uniformed patrol officer for that entire time and lived with the officer at her home, said O'Leary. He would not identify the officer because, he said, it is a personnel matter and is still under investigation.```
