```Police are using a new system to help protect their K-9 partners from being left in a hot car. Called the “Hot-N-Pop Pro” by Ace K-9, the monitoring system stays on even if the police car is shut off and stays on until the dog is let out of the car. It monitors the heat levels in the car and will automatically open windows, turn on a fan, sound the car alarm and switch on the car’s air-conditioning if it’s getting too warm.

Officers regularly handle calls and have other responsibilities where the police dog is not needed. During those times, the dog usually stays in the police vehicle with the air conditioning on. Hot car systems such as these are made to protect he dog if the AC goes out or the temperature reaches a certain level.

A device like this would probably have saved the life of Nitro, a Stockton Police K9 officer who died on June 30, after the air-conditioning in the police vehicle failed while Nitro was in the car and his handler was assisting officers with an arrest.

```Not only does the device monitor the temperature of the vehicle, it also comes with a pop-and-release feature that lets an officer click on his belt to release the back door. A similar feature likely saved Deputy Todd Frazier life when he was ambushed by three men but was able to free his K9 partner, who ended up driving off the attackers.

Police in Twinsburg, Ohio are equipping their vehicles with the potentially life-saving devices. In the video below, Twinsburg Police Officer Yamil Encarnacion discusses the device and why, for him, it’s a small amount to pay when weighed against what his K9 partner (and family member) means to him and to the community.

I love this invention and think it’s money well spent! What do you think?
