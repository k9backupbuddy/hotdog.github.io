```Police dogs serve many purposes for law enforcement agencies. Often times they are used for their superior sense of smell, but they are also used to apprehend suspects. As such, these animals face many risks. One, though, is not necessarily the first that comes to mind, and that is being left to overheat in police cruisers. A company called Blueforce Development aims to fix this problem with a sensor that alerts police when a K-9's temperature reaches dangerous levels.```
```According to the Pennsylvania K9 Assistance Foundation, an equal number of K-9's die in heat-related situations as gunshots when on duty. Blueforce Development believes that its K9 Life Safety Bundle can prevent these deaths from occurring.```

```The system includes a sensor that is surgically implanted in the dog that sends data on the animal's internal body temperature to a small receiver attached to the animalâ€™s protective gear. If the dog's temperature falls below or exceeds a value set by the dog's handler, the data is transmitted using any in-car Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G or LTE connection inside the squad car to Blueforce's cloud servers. From there, a notification is sent to the iOS or Android device of anyone subscribed via Blueforce's system to the dog in question. These notifications take the form of audible tones, vibrations, text messages, or emails.```

```Pricing information was not made available as of this writing, which isn't that surprising given that the system isn't being marketed at the general public, but rather towards law enforcement agencies. The company did announce that the package will include five sensors that monitor temperature, humidity, and volatile organic compounds.```
