```Police dogs are crucial in the fight against crime, but when it emerged that K-9s were being left alone in police cars for prolonged periods, a security company developed a chip that monitors body temperature and avoids canine fatalities.```

```Over the last five years, according to the Pennsylvania K9 Assistance Foundation, the same number of police dogs have died due to heat-related injuries as those that died in the field - with temperatures in cars reaching up to 50C within minutes even though it may only be 27C outside.```

```Security software and services provider Blueforce Solutions has teamed up with DSI, which develops animal telemetry sensors, to create the K9 Platform.```

```A DSI sensor is implanted in the dog and relays temperature information to a receiver located within the dog’s defensive clothing.  This then communicates with Blueforce Tactical, a security app available for Android and iOS devices.```

```When the dog’s temperature gets too high or too low, everyone who has subscribed to the animal via the app will receive a vibrate, tone, email or SMS notification informing them of the animal’s plight.```

```The information is sent using in-car wi-fi or via 3G or 4G communications.```

```As well as providing a convenient way of sharing information about the dog between staff in different places – such as handlers in the field and officers at the command centre - this solution is designed to be affordable.```

```Aimed specifically at police dogs, the product is available in bundles of five as The Blueforce K9 Life Safety Bundle, and costs $4,754 (around £2,860). (via Gizmag).```
