```Person Carried/attached Environmental Sensors```
```A single deployed responder can now share SCBA data, environmental data (i.e., CO, VOC, etc), WMD (i.e., radiological, chemical, etc), and biotelemetry (i.e., heartrate, respiration, etc) using a single Android device as the “gateway” between peer responders and managers.```
```Single “Pane of Glass View” of all Deployed Assets```
```No more looking across multiple applications to determine location, proximity, environmental, and physical disposition. Blueforce Tactical and Blueforce Command Center provide a single view of fused sensing and human data so you don’t have to switch between applications.```
